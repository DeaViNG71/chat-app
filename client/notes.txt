- Update the page title, meta tags, and favicon.
- When I'm in a room and I refresh the page, I get page not found. It would be nice to be back in the same room.
- Being able to click the room id to copy it to the clipboard would be nice so you can easily share it with others.
- Maybe generating room names with real words in them would be cool, like reddit can generate usernames, e.g. tinypancakes78734
- Mobile responsiveness
- Maybe put an icon below "Create or Join a room to start a conversation!" as another way to bring up the "New Room" modal.
- Public rooms (with descriptions) that anyone can join.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
when user wants to start a new conversation
- they select a friend from their friend list then by clicking on send message
  they are taken to "/app/direct-messages/" and there they can see the user receiver's
  name and their status.
- the moment they send a message, a new conversation will be created in database after getting a success response
  we redirect user to "/app/direct-messages/:conversationId" and there they can continue their chat.
